# Exploiting-Blockchain-With-OpenAI-APIs
Contains the solutions to the Tasks that I prepared as a mentor for the ACA Project

Initially, there was an easy task for JavaScript basics, which was prepared by Rohan Ravi (co-mentor)

Then, I prepared both of the Blockchain Tasks

# Task 2.1: [Become A Blockchain Miner](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17qFM9vKWkLVz6PRR8OjgIQuXYfVC4UYQ0z-Ss-r9rsU/edit)

# Task 2.2: [Become A Blockchain Developer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10uD7wjIVYli19E2Y9Qpo71uHgQvmSha3vshplnOsDdI/edit?usp=sharing)

Then, a task for teaching APIs was prepared by Rohan.

Finally, the final task was prepared by me...

# Final Task: Part I 
## [OpenAI NFT MarketPlace](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dmR5o5-JHIJx9jcVHjR6z6YgBF3eo8psueYZMQPGZzM/edit?usp=sharing )
This is the most interesting task. It runs on a nodeJS runtime environment. 

We first mint an NFT using a user-input image. Instead of using a centralized cloud or local database, we use a decentralized database called IPFS.

The blockchain for maintaining NFTs is Solana. The project is currently deployed on Solana Devnet.

After NFT is minted, there appears a button to publish it on the marketplace.

## Further Parts of the task (to be uploaded soon)

Instead of taking a user-input image, we will take a user-input text prompt and convert that NL Text into an image using DallE provided by openAI

Finally, we will also implement cross-wallet NFT transfer functionality so that users can actually use the marketplace to buy NFTs
